Can't you see that you're smothering me? Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control because everything that you thought I would be is falling apart right in front of you. Cutting the undertow. Just cut in the undertow. Every step that I take is another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow. And every second I waste is more than I can take.
